* frame-purpose.el

 =frame-purpose= makes it easy to open purpose-specific frames that only show certain buffers, e.g. by buffers' major mode, their filename or directory, etc, with custom frame/X-window titles, icons, and other frame parameters.

 Note that this does not lock buffers to certain frames, and it does not prevent frames from showing any buffer.  It works by overriding the =buffer-list= function so that, within a purpose-specific frame, any code that uses =buffer-list= (e.g. =list-buffers=, =ibuffer=, Helm buffer-related commands) will only show buffers for that frame's purpose.  You could say that, within a purpose-specific frame, you would have to "go out of your way" to show a buffer that's not related to that frame's purpose.

*Note:* You may also find the [[https://github.com/akirak/frame-workflow][frame-workflow]] package useful, which integrates with this one.

** Usage

 First, enable =frame-purpose-mode=.  This overrides =buffer-list= with a function that acts appropriately on purpose-specific frames.  When the mode is disabled, =buffer-list= is returned to its original definition, and purpose-specific frames will no longer act specially.

 There are some built-in interactive commands:

 + =frame-purpose-make-directory-frame=: Make a purpose-specific frame for buffers associated with DIRECTORY.  DIRECTORY defaults to the current buffer's directory.
 + =frame-purpose-make-mode-frame=: Make a purpose-specific frame for buffers in major MODE.  MODE defaults to the current buffer's major mode.
 + =frame-purpose-show-sidebar=: Show list of purpose-specific buffers on SIDE of this frame.  When a buffer in the list is selected, the last-used window switches to that buffer.  Makes a new buffer if necessary.  SIDE is a symbol, one of left, right, top, or bottom.

 For more fine-grained control, or for scripted use, the primary function is =frame-purpose-make-frame=.

*** Examples

 Make a frame to show only Org-mode buffers, with a custom frame (X window) title and icon:

 #+BEGIN_SRC elisp
   (frame-purpose-make-frame :modes 'org-mode
                             :title "Org"
                             :icon-type "~/src/emacs/org-mode/logo.png")
 #+END_SRC

 Make a frame to show only [[https://github.com/jgkamat/matrix-client-el][matrix-client]] buffers, with a custom frame (X window) title and icon, and showing a list of buffers in a sidebar window on the right side of the frame:

 #+BEGIN_SRC elisp
   (frame-purpose-make-frame :modes 'matrix-client-mode
                             :title "Matrix"
                             :icon-type (expand-file-name "~/src/emacs/matrix-client-el/logo.png")
                             :sidebar 'right)
 #+END_SRC

Make a frame to show only Web-development-related buffers:

 #+BEGIN_SRC elisp
   ;; `:modes' can be one or a list of items, each of which may be either a major mode symbol, or a
   ;; string which is matched as a regexp against major mode names.
   (frame-purpose-make-frame :modes '("html-" "css-" js-mode)
                             :title "Web development")
 #+END_SRC

** Installation

Install =dash.el=, put =frame-purpose.el= in your =load-path=, and =(require 'frame-purpose)= in your init file.

The package may be submitted to MELPA in the future.

*** =use-package= and =general=

If you use [[https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package][use-package]] and [[https://github.com/noctuid/general.el#general-keyword][general]] (and you should), you could put this in your init file:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(use-package frame-purpose
  :general
  (:prefix "M-SPC"
    "Fd" #'frame-purpose-make-directory-frame
    "Fm" #'frame-purpose-make-mode-frame))
#+END_SRC

Then you could press =M-SPC F d= to open a new directory-specific frame, and =M-SPC F m= to open a new mode-specific frame.

** Notes and Prior Art

There are a variety of powerful packages to help users manage buffers, like [[https://github.com/wasamasa/eyebrowse][eyebrowse]], [[https://github.com/nex3/perspective-el][perspective]], [[https://github.com/Bad-ptr/persp-mode.el][persp-mode]], [[https://github.com/tlh/workgroups.el][workgroups]], [[https://github.com/pashinin/workgroups2][workgroups2]], and others.  I found them a bit confusing and complicated for my needs.  I simply wanted to open frames to display certain sets of buffers, e.g. to have one frame for my Matrix/IRC chat-room buffers, one for my personal Org buffers, one for a certain Emacs package's files, etc.  Some people use dedicated Emacs processes to separate tasks, but I prefer to use a single Emacs process.  Also, while some of those packages provide handy persistence features, I don't want that complexity, and I don't necessarily want buffers or frames automatically opened when I start Emacs (and =desktop.el= provides that, when I need it).

So when I discovered the =buffer-predicate= frame parameter, and realized that I could (apparently!) safely override =buffer-list= with a version that uses frames' =buffer-predicate=, this package naturally fell into place as a simple way to make purpose-specific frames.
