;;; frame-purpose.el --- Purpose-specific frames  -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;; Author: Adam Porter <adam@alphapapa.net>
;; URL: http://github.com/alphapapa/frame-purpose.el
;; Version: 1.0.0-pre
;; Package-Requires: ((emacs "25.1") (dash "2.12") (dash-functional "1.2.0"))
;; Keywords: buffers, convenience, frames

;;; Commentary:

;; `frame-purpose' makes it easy to open purpose-specific frames that only show certain buffers,
;; e.g. by buffers' major mode, their filename or directory, etc, with custom frame/X-window
;; titles, icons, and other frame parameters.

;; Note that this does not lock buffers to certain frames, and it does not prevent frames from
;; showing any buffer.  It works by overriding the `buffer-list' function so that, within a
;; purpose-specific frame, any code that uses `buffer-list' (e.g. `list-buffers', `ibuffer', Helm
;; buffer-related commands) will only show buffers for that frame's purpose.  You could say that,
;; within a purpose-specific frame, you would have to "go out of your way" to show a buffer that's
;; not related to that frame's purpose.

;;;; Usage:

;; First, enable `frame-purpose-mode'.  This overrides `buffer-list' with a function that acts
;; appropriately on purpose-specific frames.  When the mode is disabled, `buffer-list' is returned
;; to its original definition, and purpose-specific frames will no longer act specially.

;; There are some built-in interactive commands:

;; + `frame-purpose-make-directory-frame': Make a purpose-specific frame for buffers associated with
;; DIRECTORY.  DIRECTORY defaults to the current buffer's directory.

;; + `frame-purpose-make-mode-frame': Make a purpose-specific frame for buffers in major MODE.  MODE
;; defaults to the current buffer's major mode.

;;  + `frame-purpose-show-sidebar': Show list of purpose-specific buffers on SIDE of this frame.
;;  When a buffer in the list is selected, the last-used window switches to that buffer.  Makes a
;;  new buffer if necessary.  SIDE is a symbol, one of left, right, top, or bottom.

;; For more fine-grained control, or for scripted use, the primary function is
;; `frame-purpose-make-frame'.  For example:

;; Make a frame to show only Org-mode buffers, with a custom frame (X window) title and icon:
;; (frame-purpose-make-frame :modes 'org-mode
;;                           :title "Org"
;;                           :icon-type "~/src/emacs/org-mode/logo.png")

;; Make a frame to show only `matrix-client' buffers, with a custom frame (X window) title and icon,
;; and showing a list of buffers in a sidebar window on the right side of the frame:
;; (frame-purpose-make-frame :modes 'matrix-client-mode
;;                           :title "Matrix"
;;                           :icon-type (expand-file-name "~/src/emacs/matrix-client-el/logo.png")
;;                           :sidebar 'right)

For one reason or another, using a sidebar with buffers in these

`elfeed-search-update' uses temporary buffers to download and
process feeds, and every time it opens or closes a temp buffer,
`buffer-list' is called, which updates the list of buffers in the
sidebar, and this seems to significantly slow down the feed
updating process.  Until a fix or workaround can be found, it's
best to simply avoid using a sidebar with these major modes.  So,
if `frame-purpose-show-sidebar' is called from a buffer in one of
these major modes (or a major mode matching one of these
